# GATEQuest Supabase Documentation

Welcome to the GATEQuest database documentation. This document provides a detailed overview of the PostgreSQL schema, custom functions, and security policies that power the application, all managed by Supabase.

## üèõÔ∏è Core Entities & Relationships

The database is designed around a few core concepts. Understanding their relationships is key to understanding the application.

- **`users`**: Stores the public-facing profiles for everyone who signs up. This is linked to Supabase's private `auth.users` table.
- **`questions`**: Contains all the GATE exam questions. This is the central content of the app.
- **`user_question_activity`**: Acts as a logbook. Every time a user attempts a question, a record is created here, linking a `user` to a `question`.
- **`question_peer_stats`**: An aggregate table that stores statistics (like average time, correct attempts) for each question, calculated from the `user_question_activity` data.
- **`question_reports`**: Allows users to report issues with specific questions.
- **`notifications`**: A simple table for storing in-app notifications for users.

## üìñ Table Reference

This section provides a detailed breakdown of each table in the `public` schema.

### Table: `public.users`

Stores public profile information for authenticated users. This table is linked 1-to-1 with the private `auth.users` table.

| Column Name          | Data Type     | Constraints & Defaults                          | Description                                                                  |

| `id`                 | `uuid`        | `PRIMARY KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `DEFAULT auth.uid()` | The user's unique ID. This is a foreign key that references `auth.users.id`. |
| `joined_at`          | `timestamptz` | `NOT NULL`, `DEFAULT now()`                     | The timestamp when the user profile was created.                             |

**Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:**

- **Policy:** A user can view, insert, or update their own row in the `users` table. They cannot access anyone else's.
- **SQL Logic:** `USING (auth.uid() = id) WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id)`

## üöÄ Database Functions

Custom SQL functions to handle complex logic directly in the database.

### Function: `insert_user_question_activity_batch(batch jsonb)`

- **Purpose:** To efficiently insert multiple user activity records at once. This is more performant than making many individual API calls from the client.
- **Arguments:** Takes a single `jsonb` argument named `batch`, which should be a JSON array of activity objects.
- **Logic:** It loops through each object in the `batch` array and performs an `INSERT` into the `user_question_activity` table. It automatically calculates the `attempt_number` for each user on each question.

### Function: `refresh_question_peer_stats()`

- **Purpose:** To calculate and update the aggregate statistics in the `question_peer_stats` table.
- **Arguments:** None.
- **Logic:** It queries the `user_question_activity` table, grouping by `question_id` to calculate the total attempts, correct/wrong counts, and average time taken for first attempts (`attempt_number = 1`). It then uses `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` to either insert a new stats row or update an existing one for each question.
- **Security:** This function is `SECURITY DEFINER`, meaning it runs with the permissions of the user who defined it (the database owner), allowing it to safely read all activity data to generate accurate stats.
